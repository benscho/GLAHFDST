   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GLAHF Explorer's documentation
==========================================
I'm still testing everything out so it's probably quite rough around the edges. Sorry about that.

The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and functional online data viewer.
The GLAHF Explorer is a heavily customized version of the excellent and open-source `CMV. <http://docs.cmv.io/en/1.3.5/>`_
This documentation will mainly focus on the deviations from the standard CMV codebase.
The data available in the explorer is part of the GLAHF framework unless otherwise noted.
