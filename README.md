# GLAHF Explorer

This is a web viewer based on the configurable map viewer http://docs.cmv.io/en/1.3.3/ It is intended to be used with data from GLAHF in order to allow users to make informed decisions.

This readme is pretty much superfluous with the introduction of readthedocs to the GLAHF Explorer project. You can find our documentation locally, and at http://glahfdst.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
